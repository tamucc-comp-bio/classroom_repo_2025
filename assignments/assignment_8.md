# Lecture 9 - Exercises While Dr. Bird is at Conference

Complete the following exercises by making an R script with code that answers or addresses each question.  Make a collapsable section for each question.  Include each question as a comment inside of each collapsable section.  Use the "unrolled" coding format with pipes I've been promoting in class, and be sure to follow every comma and pipe with a "line feed". As a specific example, review the differences between the 2 code blocks in [section 5.6.1 in R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#combining-multiple-operations-with-the-pipe). I am advocating for the formating used in the second code block. 


Note: R for Data Science has been updatd more recently than the solutions, so the numbering or even the questions may not always match between exactly between the two.

### Tibbles

1. Review the solutions to _R for Data Science Exercises_ in the [Tibbles Chapter](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/tibbles.html).  

_When I suggest you review an exercise, I want you to read through the solution.  If you don't understand what's happening, then run the code._

### Data Transformation

2. Load the packages listed in [section 5.1.1 of R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html).  Review section 5.1.2, then complete [exercise 5.2.4.1](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#exercises-8) using the `filter()` command

3. Complete [exercise 5.2.4.3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#exercises-8)


4. Review the [solution to exercise 5.3.1.1](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/transform.html#exercise-5.3.1) then complete [Exercise 5.3.1.2][https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#exercises-9]

5. Review the [solution to exercise 5.4.1.1](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/transform.html#exercise-5.4.1), then complete [exercise 5.4.1.4](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#exercises-10)

6. Review the [solution to exercise 5.5.2](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/transform.html#exercise-5.5.2).  Note that I was hesitant to recommend any of the exercises in chapter 5 section 5 (`mutate()`) because they put an undue focus on working with times without using `lubridate()`.  The purpose of these exercises is to show you how to use `mutate()`, so focus on that.  I selected this particular exercise because it prompts you to use informatics to solve the a problem (why is `air_time != arr_time - dep_time`?)

7. Review the [solution to exercise 5.6.4](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/transform.html#exercise-5.6.4)

8. Review the [solution to exercise 5.7.1](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/transform.html#exercise-5.7.1), then complete [exercise 5.7.1.3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#exercises-13) in R for Data Science

### Exploratory Data Analysis

9. Complete [Exercise 7.3.4.1](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#exercises-15) in R for Data Science

10 Review the [solution to exercise 7.4.1](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/exploratory-data-analysis.html#exercise-7.4.1) then complete [exercise 7.4.1.2](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#exercises-16).
11. Complete [exercise 7.5.1.2](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#exercises-17) in R for Data Science.

12. Review the [solution to exercise 7.5.2.1](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/exploratory-data-analysis.html#two-categorical-variables) then complete [exercise 7.5.2.2](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#exercises-18) in R for Data Science.

13. Review the [solutions to exercises 7.5.3.1-2](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/exploratory-data-analysis.html#exercise-7.5.3.5), then complete [exercise 7.5.3.5](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#exercises-19) in R for Data Science
