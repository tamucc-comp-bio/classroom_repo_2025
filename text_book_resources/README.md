# Text Book Resources

This directory contains files from the [Computing Skills for Biologists](https://computingskillsforbiologists.com/) text book, which is required. All of these resources can also be found on the [website]{https://computingskillsforbiologists.com/downloads/} or [github organization](https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB) for the book.

I strongly encourage you to use these resources to help you learn the material covered in this course.
